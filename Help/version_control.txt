Explain the meaning of Version Control
Version contrtol is just that: a way to control which version is published in the main repository. 

Highlight a benefit of Version Control
All changes to the original repository are logged. Each change is linked to a specific person with their specific reason for changing it and when that person actually made the change.

Example of version control: Describe the way version control might be used on a software development team.
With multiple developers working on a project, tehy might be assigned to focus on a specific part of the project, but be asked to review each other's work.
With version control, each developer can see who made changes, when they made those changes, and why that person thought the changes were necessary.

Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)
git clone
(The same command that cloned the repository from GitHub to Visual Studio Code.)

Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
Since git is used as a way to help monitor and track all coding done, it allows developers to make assumptions correctly.
